            <h2> About </h2>
            <p> Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993[1]), also known by her stage name IU (아이유), is a South Korean
                singer-songwriter and actress. She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a
                trainee and
                debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with Lost and Found (2008), her first extended play (EP).
                Although her
                follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was only after the release of
                "Good Day", the
                lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend
                five consecutive
                weeks at the top of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on
                Billboard's "100 Greatest
                K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list </p>
